# 🚀 Day 01 – Linux User Setup with Non-Interactive Shell

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to create Linux users with **non-interactive shells** to improve system security by preventing direct login access.  
This is a **common real-world DevOps and system administration practice** for service and application accounts.

---

## 👤 What is a Non-Interactive Shell?
A non-interactive shell is a shell that **does not allow users to log in via SSH or terminal**.

It is commonly used for:
- Application users
- Service accounts
- Background processes
- Automation tools

This enforces the **Principle of Least Privilege**.

---

## 🔐 Common Non-Interactive Shells
| Shell Path | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|
| `/sbin/nologin` | Displays a message and denies login |
| `/bin/false` | Immediately terminates the session |

---

## 🛠️ Hands-on Commands Used

### ✅ Check available shells
```bash
cat /etc/shells
```

---

### ✅ Create a User with /sbin/nologin
```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /sbin/nologin appuser
```

- `-m` → Creates home directory
- `-s` → Assigns login shell

---

### ✅ Create a User with /bin/false
```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/false serviceuser
```

---

### ✅ Verify User Shell
```bash
grep appuser /etc/passwd
```

Example output:
```plain
appuser:x:1002:1002::/home/appuser:/sbin/nologin
```

---

### ✅ Attempt SSH Login (Expected to Fail)
```bash
ssh appuser@localhost
```

Expected result:
```plain
This account is currently not available.
```

---

### ✅ Change Existing User Shell to Non-Interactive
```bash
sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin existinguser
```

---

### ✅ Lock User Account (Optional Hardening)
```bash
sudo passwd -l appuser
```

---

### ✅ Check User Login Status
```bash
sudo passwd -S appuser
```

---

### ✅ Switch User Test (Will Fail)
```bash
su - appuser
```

---

📌 Real-World Use Cases

- Database service accounts (e.g., `mysql`, `postgres`)
- Application runtime users
- CI/CD agents
- Monitoring and logging services
- Security-hardened production systems

---

🧠 Key Learnings

- Not all users need shell access
- `/sbin/nologin` is preferred for clarity
- Reduces attack surface
- Essential Linux hardening practice
