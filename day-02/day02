# 🚀 Day 02 – Temporary Linux User Setup with Expiry

## 🎯 Objective
Create Linux users with an **account expiry date** to ensure **automatic access removal** for temporary users such as contractors, interns, or auditors. This automates security cleanup and follows the "Least Privilege" lifecycle.

---

## 👤 Temporary User Concept
Temporary users are accounts configured to **expire automatically** after a specific date. Once the date passes:
* The user can no longer log in.
* Any active sessions may be terminated (depending on system config).
* This prevents "forgotten" accounts from becoming security vulnerabilities.

## 🔐 Key Commands for User Management
| Command | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `useradd` | Create a new user with specific attributes. |
| `chage` | View and modify user password/account expiry information. |
| `usermod` | Modify existing user account settings (Lock/Unlock). |
| `passwd` | Set or change user passwords. |

---

## 🛠️ Hands-on Implementation

### 1. Create a User with a Specific Expiry Date
Use the `-e` flag with the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
```bash
sudo useradd -m -e 2026-01-31 tempuser
