# 📅 Day 01 – Introduction to DevOps & Environment Setup

## 📌 Objective

Understand **what DevOps is**, **why it exists**, and set up the **basic tools and environment** required for the 100 Days of DevOps journey.

---

## 🔹 What is DevOps?

DevOps is a **culture, set of practices, and tools** that combines **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)** to:

* Shorten the software development lifecycle
* Increase deployment frequency
* Improve release reliability
* Enable faster feedback and collaboration

DevOps is **not just tools** — it’s about **people, processes, and automation**.

---

## 🔹 Why DevOps is Needed

Traditional software delivery faced challenges such as:

* Slow deployments
* Manual configurations
* Poor collaboration between Dev & Ops teams
* High failure rates during releases

DevOps addresses these by introducing:

* Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* Automation & Monitoring
* Shared ownership

---

## 🔹 Core DevOps Lifecycle

The DevOps lifecycle typically includes:

1. **Plan**
2. **Develop**
3. **Build**
4. **Test**
5. **Release**
6. **Deploy**
7. **Operate**
8. **Monitor**

This cycle is **continuous and iterative**.

---

## 🔹 DevOps Key Principles

* **Automation first**
* **Continuous feedback**
* **Collaboration over silos**
* **Fail fast, learn faster**
* **Infrastructure as Code**
* **Security as a shared responsibility (DevSecOps)**

---

## 🔹 Tools We’ll Use in This Journey

Over the next 100 days, we’ll work with:

* **Linux**
* **Git & GitHub**
* **Shell Scripting**
* **Docker**
* **Kubernetes**
* **CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)**
* **Ansible**
* **Terraform**
* **AWS / Cloud basics**
* **Monitoring & Logging**
* **Security tools**
